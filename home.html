  				<h1>About Me </h1>
  				<p>I have been given the unique opportunity and privelage to pursue my dreams and aspirations. Not everyone has the same chance. Therefore, as an incoming junior Computer Science and Computer Engineering Student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I feel indebted to make a lasting impact in this world, and software is the best way to do this. With software, ideas can be implemented and released to the general public and make life easier for millions of people in a matter of seconds.<br><br><br>

				Software has really made an impact on my life and the life of billions of users on the planet. The advent of the internet has assisted me in cumulating new knowledge from various sources including some rudimentary skills in Information Technology (IT), Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Application Development, and Robotic Systems. In the future, I would like to deploy this cumulative database from my head and apply it as well as develop and deploy systems which will benefit numerous people in my city, state, country, and planet. Education is the main means of me obtaining this knowledge, and I am forever grateful. </p> <br><br>
